# Cabin-Builder
This project simulates someone building a cabin in the forest. The user will be able to navigate through a board of trees. 
In order to win the game, the player must collect a certain amount of objects as they traverse the board. 
In the game there will be a location for a plot of land and a location for a merchant.  Along the way there will be bandits, 
bears, wolves, merchants, and items. If the player is low on health or has too many items in the backpack, the player will
be able to locate the merchant to sell their items. When the player has the number of objects needs to build the cabin they
will navigate to the plot of land and win the game. If the player dies before collecting the items and reaching the plot,
they will lose.
